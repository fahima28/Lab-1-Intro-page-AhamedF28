  <p>I am in sophmore year of high school and I transferred to Thomas A. Edison CTE High School this year from Hillcrest High School. Currently my shop class is Design and Development and I decided to take this class because I am interested in coding and I think that learning this skill will help me in the future for building websites in presentations and whatnot and for projects.</p>
